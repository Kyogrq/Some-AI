Contains a maze solver AI.

## Encryption and Decryption Algorithms:

### Encryption:
- AES encryption combined with a transposition cipher for enhanced security.
- AES encryption utilizes a 512-bit key derived from user input.
- Transposition cipher rearranges characters based on a user-provided key.

### Decryption:
- Decryption reverses the encryption process.
- AES decryption requires the original initialization vector (IV) and ciphertext.
- Transposition cipher rearranges characters back to their original order using the decryption key.

(I don't reccommed actually using these)
